## Learned from this challenge

- trim string
- char funcitons
- convert string to sequence and manipulate it

## Learned during development

- function composition ```>>``` - use it if you have chain of operations on given input

If we have a chain of functions in a row, how are they combined?

```plain
let F x y z = x y z  <=> let F x y z = ((x y) z)  => left associative !
```

## Challenge notes

```Fine. Be that way!``` - If the sentence contains only white spaces
```Sure.```              - The sentence contains '?' at the end. All kind of symbols are allowed, but not all upper case
```Whoa, chill out!```   - The sentence is all upper case. All kind of symbols and letter(s) all in upper case 

```Calm down, I know what I'm doing!``` - "ask him" and "yell at him" 
 ```Whatever.```         - For the rest
